2. Full Project Showcase
```
Using Following Classifiers:
1) KNN
2) SVM
3) Random Forest
```
```
Custom user input interaction to test on the following Datasets: 
1) Iris Dataset
2) Breast Cancer Dataset
3) Wine Dataset
```
to find the most optimal classifier arguments, which would get the best trained model output as a result.

# How to Run
1. Creating the environment
```
1) Either create a virtual environment for your workspace
2) MacOS/Linux: $pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   Windows: $pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
# MacOS/Linux:
$pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Windows:
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Make sure you are in the correct path
```
Get into the according folder where the main.py is located in.
```
3. Run the app in localhost
```
streamlit run main.py
```
